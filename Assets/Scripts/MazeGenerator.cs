/*
No idea what the perlin noise does (i get it effects how the walls are instantiated just dont understand how)
Creates a 15 - 15 grid of walls at the original rotation

/*
It seems that you are creating the start point object inside the loop that generates the maze. 
This means that every time a cell with a Perlin noise value below the start point threshold is found, a new start point object will be created, which is not what you want.
To fix this issue, you can move the creation of the start point object outside of the loop that generates the maze, 
 and use the startPoint variable to store a reference to the start point object. 
Here's the modified code ^
With this modification, the script should generate the maze walls and create only one start point object when a cell with a Perlin noise value below the start point threshold is found.
